							<h1>Dhruvilsinh Jhala</h1>
							<p> Watching a YouTube video titled ‘Why Machine Learning is the future’ by Sundar Pichai gave me a feeling of consciousness, back in February 2017. 
								He states that better computational power and access to a lot of relevant data are the two main causes of the progress in ML. Working with data - whether it is data mining, 
								data analysis or data visualization and emphasizing it with ML algorithms or data storage has always made me feel exhilarating. 
								My immediate goal after masters is to become a Machine Learning Engineer. 
								In the long run I envision myself becoming a Data Scientist as I am hugely inspired by D J Patil, Former Chief Data Scientist at the White House, 
								first ever chief data scientist appointed by US government. His markers about striving for curiosity, team building, social and local problem solving always inspire me to crave for becoming a CDS.
								Apart from academics, I have been a part of many activities during my under graduation. Having participated in basket ball and having managed various events has not only improved my decision making but has also made me composed and tolerant. 
								The leadership quality during my tenure as a Head-Girl in my school and President of the department in my under graduation has also strengthened me with respect to the decision making power.  
								I am a motivated and a versatile engineer with demonstrated experience in Machine Learning domain. Experienced in data extraction, developing ML algorithms and developing final predictive model. I believe that I am a strong problem solver, technical writer and have excellent communication skills. 
								I am dedicated to exceeding goals and expectations.

									<h2>Internships</h2>
									<h3><u>Data Scientist Intern</u></h3>
										<p>iSimle Technologies, Illinois Chicago</p>

<p>I was a part of the Enterprise Data Science team which was developing products around Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning domain. My role was to research and develop a software with my team in the field of NeuroMarketing.

Neuromarketing is the application of neuroscience to marketing, by tracking brain activity. We mainly used Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Eye Tracking data to work. Using this data we predicted the efficiency of any product in the market using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models deployed on Cloud.</p>

<h3><u>Machine Learning Intern</u></h3>
										<p>Smart Bridge, Hydrabad ,India</p>

<p>I was allocated a project to predict Life Expectancy of people all over the world based on 14 factors - Adult Mortality rate, Infant deaths, Alcohol, Hepatitis B, Measles, BMI, Polio, Total expenditure, Diphtheria, HIV/AIDS, GDP of a country, Population, Income composition of resources, Schooling and status of the country in terms of Developing or Developed. The Machine Learning, regression model was created on IBM Watson Studio and deployed on IBM Node Red service with an accuracy of 89 percent.  </p>

									<h3>Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning.</h3>
									<p>This is a Regression based Machine Learning project which leverages historical data with 14 features
to predict insights into the future. This problem statement is aimed at predicting Life Expectancy rate
based on various factors with an accuracy of 89 percent. The Machine Learning model is linked to
Node-Red user interface. Project link - https://tinyurl.com/ya9klkuz

									<h3>Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Tweets Dashboard</h3>
									<p>This was a IBM Hack Challange 2020 topic to perform sentiment analysis of Indians after the extension of lockdown announcements to be analyzed with the relevant tags on twitter and build a predictive analytics model to understand the behavior of people if the lockdown is further extended. The project uses Tweepy API to fetch tweets on runtime and created the visualization dashboard on IBM Watson platform itself.</p>
